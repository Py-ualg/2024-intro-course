Dear David and Paulo,

 

Many thanks for the confirmation of my spot in the course.

 

Attached is an example dataset, of the type of data I usually use for fisheries research. 
The original datasets are very large and have confidentially issues for sharing. As such, 
this is a subset of part of the data only, but that should be sufficient to show and 
experiment with during the course.

The dataset is already a little bit processed, with some additional variables that were 
calculated and added (in this case in R). For this  type of data, the variables SWO.cpue 
and BUM.cpue would be response variables, while the others are potential explanatory 
covariates used for building statistical models.
